ti.to - szamlazz.hu integration proxy service

## What?

[Ti.to](https://ti.to/) is a great ticketing and attendee manager service for events both free and paid.

[Szamlazz.hu](https://szamlazz.hu) is a great invoicing service that covers and handles  all Hungarian tax laws regarding invoices.

## Why?

For larger scale events and conferences in Hungary, we have to put certain mediated services (such as catering for example) on the invoice as a separate item.
Tito can't and probably should not handle this.

## How does this work?

This service, deployed on Heroku, sits between Ti.to and Szamlazz.hu. The chain of events are like this:

1. A purchase is made on Tito
2. Tito calls a webhook on the service
3. The service gets all requred data about the purchase from the Tito API
4. The service creates an invoice XML and send it to Szamlazz.hu using [ewngs/szamlazz.js](https://github.com/ewngs/szamlazz.js)

## Caveats

* This service handles purchases that are already paid via Paypal.
* Free tickets, or manually added tickets are ignored
* Sends an email if some error happens
* Uses the Heroku provided Mailgun service to send test and error emails
* Can handle multiple events, check out the contents of `.env.example` and `events-config.yaml`

## Setup & Configuration

- Clone the repo
- Deploy it to your Heroku account using the tokens and secrets below

Generate a random hash that you'll use as a webhook URL validation token.
Add it to the app settings as an ENV variable `TITO_WEBHOOK_TOKEN`

Get your webhook URL:

`https://__YOUR_DEPLOYED_HEROKU_URL__/register-purchase?token=__TITO_WEBHOOK_TOKEN__`

- Go to your Ti.to event `Dashboard > Settings > Webhook endpoints`
- enter the webhook url you created above
- check the `registration.finished` webhook event

On the Webhook endpoints UI, you see a **Security token**, something like :

> Your security token is `7AD1__________`.

Copy that token, and add it to the Heroku app settings as an environment variable, this will be the **webhook signature validator key**, to validate webhook payload content. **Make sure that this ENV variable name is the same as the `tito-signature-validator-env` field for your event in the `events-config.yaml`**


### ENV variables

See the `.env.example` file.

#### Tito secrets and tokens

- **TITO_WEBHOOK_TOKEN** the token that is sent in the `token` query parameter. This is just an additional layer of security
- **TITO_API_TOKEN** the API token for your tito account, [see the relevant docs on Ti.to](https://ti.to/docs/api/admin#authentication)

And the Tito webhook signature validator keys, which can be in any kind of ENV variable as long as it is
referred properly with the `tito-signature-validator-env` field in the `events-config.yaml` config file.

See the [Ti.to documentation on validating webhook payloads](https://ti.to/docs/api/admin#webhooks-payloads)

#### Szamlazz.hu secrets

- **SZAMLAZZ_TOKEN** the "Számla Agent" token from Szamlazz.hu

#### Mailgun parameters

These are set automatically if you set up Mailgun on Heroku

- **MAILGUN_API_KEY**
- **MAILGUN_DOMAIN**
- **MAILGUN_PUBLIC_KEY**
- **MAILGUN_SMTP_LOGIN**
- **MAILGUN_SMTP_PASSWORD**
- **MAILGUN_SMTP_PORT** Default: 587
- **MAILGUN_SMTP_SERVER** Default: smtp.mailgun.org

#### Error reporting

- **ERROR_EMAIL_ADDRESS** the email address to send error reports

**Note:** if you use the free, sandbox Mailgun integration, set this email as an authorized recipient

### events-config.yaml

```yaml

events:

  # every event entry key is the "event slug" in tito, example: "jsconf-budapest-2021"
  tito-event-slug:

      - ticket-name-contains: "workshop"
        date: "September 23, 2020"

    # certain mediated services, such as the catering, has to be included on the invoice as a separate item
    # you can handle several amounts of catering in the ticket prices based on the ticket name
    # the net price of the catering has to be provided, it will be calculated and subtracted from the ticket price in Tito
    catering:
        # if the ticket name contains "workshop", calculate with 20 EUR net catering price
      - ticket-name-contains: "workshop"
        net-price: 20
        # if the ticket name contains "online", do not calculate catering
        # providing 0 net price will omit the catering item entry from the invoice for this type of ticket
      - ticket-name-contains: "online"
        net-price: 0
        # amount of catering for every other kind of ticket
      - ticket-name-contains: "*"
